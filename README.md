# Serverless Performance Tests

Different tests to assess the performance of different serverless frameworks.

Initially it will include the most common Python frameworks, such as Zappa, Serverless Framework and AWS Chalice. Even if the purpose of each of those frameworks is different and their options are different too, this is only to add more information on Lambda cold and warm starts.

Feel free to add more tests in different languages or using other frameworks.
